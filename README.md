### SemiStatic Dictionary

This is a simple SemiStatic Dictionary implementation using `chainable interface` to neutralize the structure.

**Features :**

* Neutralized by the `chainable interface`
* `NÃ—log(N)` complexity in adding and seeking elements (changeable to `N` or even `1` at you desire)
* Synergy towards `chainables`, able to print all the elements easily
* Encapsulated in Abstract Datatypes
* Destructor method to delete all the dictionary structure (excluding the items added to it)
